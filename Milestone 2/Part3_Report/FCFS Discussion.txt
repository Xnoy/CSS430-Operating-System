If you were to modify queue2 to run like a FCFS algorithm rather than a 2000ms time quantum, then the overall program would end sooner. 
This is because the program would run the thread until it ended rather than switch threads. This would mean that the CPU would not idle
and the threads would run for the correct amount of time. When I say this, I mean that since we are not specifying a time quantum, the 
threads would run for their need amount rather than 2000ms (which may be too much or too little). If you look inside the statistic.pdf,
you will see that the data for FCFS ends at 15000ms, while MQFS ends at 17500 and RR at 16000. This is a 1 second difference between the 
fastest program and the new MFQS with modfications to queue2. This is assuming that you run the program without interruption or using finite timeslices.

For more detailed data, please view the statistics.pdf and the gantt charts inside. (gantt charts are hard to make in excel, maybe open 
this part of the report to hand drawn charts next time :) )
